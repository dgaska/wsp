			<h4 id="intent_head">Site Intent</h4>
				<p>The intent of the redesign for this site is to make the site have an overall better presentation. 
				Right now the site works but is missing some visual aesthetics. The goal is to make this website six 
				pages with all the information the user is looking for, but also easy for the user to use. St. Francis 
				Animal Hospital also would like the site more visually appealing to the user than it is now. The users 
				of the site will want to be able to go to the site and find the information they need about the hospital. 
				They the user would like to know what services the animal hospital provides, as well as the staff 
				information so they know whom they are dealing with. If the user is comfortable using the site and have 
				knowledge of whom and what the hospital offers the user will feel comfortable bringing their pet to 
				St. Francis Hospital for Animals.</p>
